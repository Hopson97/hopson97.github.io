## Building and Running

### Linux

To build, at the root of the project:

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh
```

To run, at the root of the project:

```sh
sh scripts/run.sh
```

To build and run in release mode, simply add the `release` suffix:

```sh
sh scripts/build.sh release
sh scripts/run.sh release
```

You can also create a deployable build (that can be sent) by doing:

```sh
sh scripts/deploy.sh
```
