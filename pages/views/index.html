<p>Welcome! My name is Matt and I enjoy programming, music, and going on hikes. On this website you will be able to find some of my project and other random stuff I felt like putting on here as well :)</p>
<p>I am currently a software engineering student at the University of Portsmouth, and I will be graduating in 2021.</p>
